5 Principles for Object Oriented Design(OOD)

### 1. S - Single responsibility Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### 2. O - Open/Close Principle
Open for extension but closed for modification

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
If Class B is a subtype od class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program

### 4. Interface Segmented Principle
Interfaces should be such, that client should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
Classes should depend on Interfaces rather than depending on concrete classes
